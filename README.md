PhotoAppAndroid is a mobile application developed in Java for the Android platform, allowing users to manage their photos. 
Here's a brief description of its features:
1. CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete):
   The app enables users to add new photos to existing albums, view existing photos, and delete them as needed. Also can add key words, title to photo.
2. Sort, filter the Photos
3. Take Photo from Camera:
   Users can take new photos directly using their device's camera. The application utilizes the device's camera functionality, allowing users to instantly add new photos to their albums.
4. Choose Photo from Gallery:
   The app allows users to select existing photos from their device's gallery. Users can browse their photos and select the ones they want to add to their albums.
5. Retrieve Photo Location:
   The application can access the location where a photo was taken (if users grant the necessary permissions). This feature enables users to see exactly where each photo was taken, which can be useful for organizing photos based on location. PhotoAppAndroid provides a simple, intuitive user interface that makes it easy to manage photos, both those taken on the spot and those previously saved in the device's gallery. Additionally, the ability to retrieve the location of a photo adds geotagging functionality, which can help provide context to where the photo was taken.
